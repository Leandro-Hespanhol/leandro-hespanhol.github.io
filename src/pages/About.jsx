          <h1>What about me?</h1>
          <p>At first I would like to present myself doing two things I love: Riding my bike and be with my friends. I also love coding but lets not get too personal right away ðŸ˜‰</p>
          <p>Studying usually is something that comes to me with ease. Probably because learning is such a rewarding experience to me. I like to say that <strong>Curiosity guides me.</strong> </p>
          <p>I am a graduaded lawyer, but from the beggining my technology skills made myself be seen by my bosses. After one year and a half I was called to join the technology team on my office. I was working on a suport post which gave me and incredible vision about artificial inteligence and made myself make the changing career decision!</p>

          <p>And not just that! To know how to learn is one of the main skills im improving on my study. Because of that, learning a different language would not be a problem! </p>
